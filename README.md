# Project Summary

## Introduction
Welcome to the project on "Data Encryption using AWS KMS." I'm Ameer Suhail, and I will show you the project summary.

## Platform Overview
- This project takes place on the Rhyme platform.
- You'll find two desktops on your screen: one for a recorded video and one for a cloud desktop.
- Feel free to practice along or pause the video as needed.

## Encryption Basics
- Encryption is the process of converting data into code to prevent unauthorized access.
- Decryption is the reverse process to retrieve the original data.

## Types of Encryption
- Two main types: "Encryption at Rest" and "Encryption in Transit."
- "Encryption at Rest" protects against physical theft or tampering.
- "Encryption in Transit" secures data during transmission.

## AWS KMS
- AWS Key Management Service (KMS) is used to create, store, and manage cryptographic keys for data encryption and decryption.

## Cryptographic Keys
- Two key types: symmetric and asymmetric.
- AWS KMS can handle both.
- Symmetric keys for symmetric encryption, asymmetric keys for asymmetric encryption.

## Symmetric Encryption
- Sender and receiver agree on an algorithm and share a secret key.
- Sender encrypts data (plaintext) into ciphertext using the key and algorithm.
- Ciphertext is transmitted to the receiver.
- Receiver uses the same key and algorithm to decrypt ciphertext back into plaintext.

## Getting Started
- Log in to the AWS console as an admin user.
- Create an access key for programmatic access.
- Configure AWS CLI for programmatic access (explained in detail in the project).

## Logging in with AWS CLI
- Demonstrates how to programmatically log in to your AWS console using the AWS CLI.
- Profiles are used for managing multiple AWS accounts.

# Creating Customer Managed Keys (CMKs) in AWS KMS - Tutorial Summary

## CMKs Overview
- CMKs are fundamental resources in AWS KMS.
- They serve as logical representations of master keys.
- CMKs contain metadata such as key ID, creation date, description, and key state.
- Key material within CMKs is used for data encryption and decryption.
- Physical key material can be generated by KMS or imported into KMS.

## CMK Usage
- CMKs enable direct encryption and decryption of data, supporting payloads up to 4KB in size.

## Creating a CMK
- Log in to the AWS console as an admin user and search for "KMS."
- Click on "Key Management Service" to access the KMS console.
- Click "Create key" to initiate CMK creation.
- Choose between symmetric and asymmetric keys; for this demo, select symmetric.
- In advanced options, set the key material origin (KMS or external) â€“ choose KMS.
- Specify a key alias (e.g., "test") and provide an optional description.
- Designate a key administrator, for instance, "IAM admin."
- Determine who can use the key for cryptographic operations, and check "IAM admin."
- The final key policy summarizes the key's settings.
- Click "Finish" to create the CMK.

## Key Rotation
- Key rotation is turned off by default but can be enabled to rotate the key once a year.

# Encrypting Sensitive Data using a Symmetric Customer Master Key 

## Scenario
- We imagine a scenario where a king needs to securely discuss battle plans with a soldier head.
- Encryption is crucial to protect the sensitive information being shared.

## Creating a Plain Text Message
- I will show you how to create a plain text message using the `echo` command and save it to 'testmsg.txt.'
- The message contains battle instructions.

## Encryption Process
  - I will provide a detailed encryption command with components:
  - AWS command invoking KMS service with the 'encrypt' action.
  - Specification of the key ID or alias for the symmetric customer master key.
  - Using the 'testmsg.txt' file as the plain text input.
  - Configuration to output the result as text.
  - Selection of the 'Ciphertext-Blob' field using '--query' to extract the cipher text.

## Converting to Binary Encrypted File
- I will instruct you on how to pass the Base64 encoded output to a utility called '64' to obtain a binary encrypted file.

## Testing the Encrypted File
- I will demonstrate viewing the contents of the encrypted file ('not_testmsg.enc'), showing the cipher text.

  # Decrypting Data Using a Symmetric Customer Master Key - Task Summary

## Symmetric Encryption Overview
- I will emphasize the key's crucial role in symmetric encryption.
- Secure key transmission is essential for successful decryption.

## Secure Key Transmission
- I will acknowledge the challenge of securely transmitting the decryption key from the sender (king) to the receiver (soldier head).
- Notes that symmetric encryption may not be suitable for scenarios where data needs to be transmitted securely (encryption in transit).

## Decrypting Cipher Text
  - I will explain the decryption process step by step:
  - Uses AWS commands to call the KMS service for the 'decrypt' action.
  - Specifies the cipher text using '--ciphertextblob' and references the file containing the encrypted data.
  - Requests the output in text format.
  - Passes the profile name ('iamadmin-general') to indicate the AWS account being accessed.
  - Uses the '--query' field to extract the plain text from the output, which is Base64 encoded.
  - Redirects the decoded output to a file named 'decryptedplan.base64' and executes the command.

## Decoding the Decrypted Data
- I will show you how to decode the 'decryptedplan.base64' file using the 'certutil' command.
- Converts the decoded data to a text file named 'decryptedplan.txt'.

## Verification
- I will demonstrate viewing the decrypted data by typing 'type decryptedplan.txt,' which displays the original message.

## Conclusion on Symmetric Encryption
- I will summarize that symmetric encryption uses the same key and algorithm for both encryption and decryption.

  # Creating an Asymmetric Customer Master Key 

## Asymmetric Encryption Overview
- I will highlight that asymmetric encryption is particularly useful when securely transferring data.
- It involves both sender and receiver agreeing on an asymmetric algorithm and generating their unique keys.

## Components of an Asymmetric Key
- I will explain that an asymmetric encryption key consists of two parts: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
- Emphasizes that each party must possess their own public and private keys.

## Encryption and Decryption Process
- I will underscore that the public key generates cipher text, and only the corresponding private key can decrypt it.
- Clarifies that public keys cannot decrypt data they encrypted; only private keys can perform decryption.

## Use of Public Keys on Public Platforms
- In asymmetric encryption, both sender and receiver upload their public keys to public platforms (e.g., Twitter or cloud storage).
- When sending encrypted data, the sender downloads the receiver's public key, encrypts the data, and transmits it.
- Only the receiver, possessing the private key, can decrypt the data.

# Conclusion
We've reached the end, and the project is officially completed!
